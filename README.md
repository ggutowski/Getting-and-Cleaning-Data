## Analysis
- This analysis performs the following:  

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.   
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set   
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.   
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  

- To repeat the analysis:  

1. Download the data from the link above.
2. Unzip the downloaded data.
3. Put the run_analysis.R script in the same directory as the data.
4. Execute the run_analysis.R script.


## Tidy Datasets

The first resulting tidy dataset is a merged file of the training and test datasets which includes only the mean and standard deviation of ecah measurement. Descriptive labels are correctly applied to the tidy data.
